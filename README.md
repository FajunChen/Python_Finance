Python_Finance
==============

This repository was orginally created to store python HW scripts for Georgia Institute of Technology 
Computational Finance I. However, wide distribution of these scripts violates anybody's honor code. Therefore, I have
refrained from uploading all of the code that I created for that course beyond the original first HW assignment or variants of that code.

I have added additional python scripts for various other projects related to quantitative finance that don't compromise 
the Georgia Tech Computational Finance I course.
